                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") applies to all who use the website accessible at https://www.polyprofits.co (the "Site"), which is owned and operated by PolyProfits, a Delaware limited liability company, and its subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, officers, and directors (collectively, "PolyProfits"). For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the words "you" and "your" refer to each individual accessing and using the Site, and "PolyProfits" may sometimes be referred to herein as "us," "our," or "we." The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you what information we may collect, how we use such information and who we will share such information with, if at all, when you access and use the Site.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy does not address the privacy practices of any third parties that we do not own, control, or are affiliated with. By accessing or using the Site, you confirm your agreement to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the Privacy Policy, you may not access or use the Site. This Privacy Policy applies only to our online activities and is valid for visitors to the Site with regard to the information that they share and that we collect on the Site. This Privacy Policy is not applicable to any information collected offline or via channels other than the Site.</p>
                <p>We take the privacy concerns of our Site visitors seriously. Therefore, if you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at team@polyprofits.co.</p>

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

                <p>Like most website operators, we also collect non-personally identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use our Site. We may also gather certain information automatically, such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), operating system, your Site activity (including the Site content you view, mouse movements, mouse clicks, taps, swipes, and information you view), and/or clickstream data for purposes such as analyzing trends, administering the Site, improving the function and content of the Site, and enforcing our Terms of Use. We use standard Internet technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, session replay/screen capture, and similar technologies to collect this information, as explained below in the section on cookies.</p>
                <p>We may also collect precise information about your location, such as your mobile device's GPS coordinates, cell tower information, and/or Wi-Fi signals. We may use this information to personalize your experience in connection with your use of the Site. If you do not want us to collect and use your specific geolocation information, you can disable the location features on your device. Check your device manufacturer settings for how to do so.</p>

                </ul>

                <h2>How We Share Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We work with various third-party partners who help us provide and improve our services. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we have no plans to do so. We also impose restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. We have summarized how we share the information we collect below.</p>
                <p>If you have purchased services from us, we may share your personal contact information with prospective customers, which is limited to your first name, first letter of your last name, phone number, and your state of residence. A prospective customer may contact you to compare your experience with what we told you about our services.</p>
                <p>We may share your information with our affiliates (companies that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with PolyProfits) as well as select partners. Examples of how these entities may use your information include making predictions about your interests and providing you with special offers, promotions, advertisements, and other materials related to AI arbitrage services.</p>
                <p>We may share your information with vendors that perform functions on our behalf. Examples of such functions include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, email administrative functions, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.</p>
                <p>We may also disclose your information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, legal proceedings, or similar legal process, including disclosure to authorized third-party auditors; or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate or prevent fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>

                <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
                <p>As with any other website, the Site uses "cookies." Cookies are small record-keeping files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your web browser. Cookies allow our systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information in order to make your future interaction with the Site easier and more convenient. We may allow third parties to use cookies on the Site, but we do not control the use or contents of third-party cookies. Web browsers often allow you to configure the browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. If you elect to reject cookies, please note that you may not be able to take full advantage of the features and functions of the Site.</p>
                <p>For more general information on cookies, please visit: <a href="https://www.cookieconsent.com/what-are-cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cookieconsent.com/what-are-cookies/</a>.</p>

                <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
                <p>The Site may contain links to websites operated and maintained by third parties over which we have no control. Any information you provide to third-party websites will be governed under the terms of each website's privacy policy, and we encourage you to investigate such policies before disclosing any information to the operators of third-party websites. We have no responsibility or liability for the content, actions, or policies of third-party websites. The inclusion of links to third-party websites on our Site in no way constitutes an endorsement of such websites' content, actions, or policies.</p>

                <h2>Google AdWords for Remarketing</h2>
                <p>We use remarketing services to advertise on third-party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our Site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't completed a task on our Site, for example using the contact form to make an inquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on a site in the Google Display Network or the Google search results page. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits. Any data collected will be used in accordance with Google's privacy policy and our own.</p>
                <p>You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and you can opt-out of interest-based advertising entirely by adjusting your cookie settings or using a browser plugin.</p>

                <h2>Opting-Out From Receiving Communications</h2>
                <p>You may opt-out from having your personal information used for certain purposes. For example, if you purchase services from the Site but do not wish to have your personal contact information shared with other prospective customers, you may opt-out by emailing us at team@polyprofits.co.</p>

                <h2>Updates</h2>
                <p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. If we make significant changes, we will notify you of the changes through the Site or through other means, such as email. To the extent permitted under applicable law, by using our Site after such notice, you consent to our updates to this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
