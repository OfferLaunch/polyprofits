                    <h3>2.2 Arbitrage OS License</h3>
                    <p>If your Program includes software access, you receive a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use Arbitrage OS during your active subscription strictly for your internal business purposes and, where expressly permitted by your plan, to deploy limited downstream, end-client usage as part of services you deliver to your customers.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2.3 Community</h3>
                    <p>"Community" means any PolyProfits spaces (e.g., Heartbeat, Slack, Circle, Discord, live calls, events, or similar).</p>
                    
                    <h3>2.4 Confidential Information and Company IP</h3>
                    <p>are defined in Sections 6 and 7.</p>

                <h2>3. TERM; DURATION; RENEWAL</h2>
                    <h3>3.1 Program Term</h3>
                    <p>Unless otherwise stated at checkout, access to coaching, community, and curriculum is provided for a minimum commitment of twelve (12) months ("Initial Term"). Certain course content may remain available thereafter at our discretion; live/coaching benefits do not.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3.2 Subscription Renewal</h3>
                    <p>Where a subscription applies (monthly/annual), it auto-renews for successive periods at the then-current rate unless cancelled at least seven (7) days before renewal in your account portal or via written notice to team@polyprofits.co.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3.3 No Circumvention</h3>
                    <p>Cancellation ends future renewals only; it does not waive or reduce amounts already owed, payment plans, or minimum commitments.</p>

                <h2>4. FEES; PAYMENT; TAXES; LATE AMOUNTS; CHARGEBACKS</h2>
                    <h3>4.1 Fees</h3>
                    <p>You agree to pay all fees indicated at checkout or in your order form. All amounts are in U.S. Dollars and exclusive of taxes, which you must pay where applicable.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4.2 Payment Plans</h3>
                    <p>If a payment plan is offered and selected, you authorize us (and our processors) to automatically charge the payment method on file for each installment when due, without further notice, until paid in full.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4.3 Failed Payments; Cure Period</h3>
                    <p>If a charge is declined, you must provide a valid replacement method within three (3) business days. We may disable access until amounts are current.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4.4 Late Fees; Interest; Collections</h3>
                    <p>Past-due amounts may accrue interest at 1.5% per month (18% APR) or the maximum allowed by law, plus reasonable collection costs and attorneys' fees. We may accelerate the remaining balance of any plan upon default.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4.5 No Set-Off</h3>
                    <p>You waive any right of set-off or counterclaim against amounts due.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4.6 Chargebacks are Breach</h3>
                    <p>Initiating a chargeback without first emailing team@polyprofits.co and allowing five (5) business days to resolve is a material breach. If a chargeback is reversed in our favor, you agree to reimburse direct scheme fees ($25 per incident) plus an administrative fee of $250.</p>

                <h2>5. MODIFICATIONS TO SERVICES</h2>
                    <p>We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Services (including schedules, features, vendors, or integrations) upon notice (email or in-app). Material reductions in core purchased features will be accompanied by commercially reasonable alternatives.</p>

                <h2>6. CONFIDENTIALITY; NON-DISCLOSURE</h2>
                    <h3>6.1 Definition</h3>
                    <p>"Confidential Information" means non-public information disclosed by either party that a reasonable person would consider confidential, including business plans, strategies, financials, product roadmaps, customer lists, pricing, proposals, frameworks, templates, source materials, community content, and any information identified as confidential.</p>
                    
                    <h3>6.2 Obligations</h3>
                    <p>Each party will: (a) use Confidential Information only to perform under this Agreement; (b) not disclose it to third parties except to employees/contractors with a need-to-know and who are bound by confidentiality terms no less protective; and (c) protect it using no less than reasonable care.</p>
                    
                    <h3>6.3 Exclusions</h3>
                    <p>Confidential Information does not include data that is (i) publicly available through no fault of recipient; (ii) independently developed; or (iii) rightfully received from a third party without confidentiality obligations.</p>
                    
                    <h3>6.4 Community Privacy</h3>
                    <p>You may not record, scrape, download, redistribute, or publicly share any live call, replay, screenshot, or Community content without our prior written consent.</p>
                    
                    <h3>6.5 Compelled Disclosure</h3>
                    <p>If legally compelled, a party may disclose Confidential Information after giving prompt notice (if legally permitted) to allow the other party to seek protective relief.</p>
                    
                    <h3>6.6 Survival</h3>
                    <p>These obligations survive five (5) years from termination; trade secrets survive as long as legally protected.</p>

                <h2>7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; LICENSES; RESTRICTIONS</h2>
                    <h3>7.1 Ownership</h3>
                    <p>PolyProfits and its licensors exclusively own all Company IP, including Arbitrage OS, software, code, documentation, text, audio/video content, curriculum, templates, frameworks, workflows, prompts, playbooks, community content we create, trademarks, and trade dress. No assignment of IP is made.</p>
                    
                    <h3>7.2 License to You</h3>
                    <p>Subject to your compliance and timely payment, PolyProfits grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access/use Company IP strictly for your internal business during the applicable Term.</p>
                    
                    <h3>7.3 Downstream Use (Client Delivery)</h3>
                    <p>If your plan explicitly includes end-client enablement, you may use Company IP only as embedded within your services delivered to your end clients, not as standalone resalable IP or software, and not to create competing courses, toolkits, or platforms.

                    <h3>11.2 90-Day Client Acquisition Guarantee (Conditional)</h3>
                    <p>If you do not acquire a first paying client after completing the full ninety (90) days of participation in the Program, you may request a refund (minus a $500 processing fee) only between day 90 and day 97 following your purchase date, provided you strictly satisfy all of the following requirements (the "Guarantee Requirements"):</p>
                    <p>(a) Curriculum Completion. Complete 100% of the core course within fourteen (14) days of purchase, as recorded in our LMS.</p>
                    <p>(b) Daily Action Log ("Top 1"). Post a Daily Top 1 action update in the Community every calendar day for the full 90-day period (minimum 50 words each), describing the single highest-impact action you personally performed to acquire clients. Missing more than three (3) days total voids the guarantee.</p>
                    <p>(c) Coaching Attendance. Attend all weekly live coaching calls during the 90-day period; watching replays does not count.</p>
                    <p>(d) Prospecting Activity. Maintain verifiable outreach consistent with Program guidance (e.g., cold email/DM/meetings logged). Upon request, provide timestamped records (spreadsheets or CRM exports) evidencing prospect lists, sent messages, replies, bookings, and follow-ups.</p>
                    <p>(e) Refund Consultation. Schedule and attend a refund consultation call with our designated representative during the 7-day window following day 90. Requests submitted before day 90 or after day 97 will not be accepted.</p>
                    
                    <h3>11.3 Guarantee Limitations</h3>
                    <p>The guarantee is void if you (i) breach this Agreement; (ii) fail any single requirement in Section 11.2; (iii) behave disruptively in the Community; (iv) submit a refund request before day 90 or after day 97; or (v) secure $25,000 or more in contracted revenue attributable to Program methods within the 90-day period.</p>
                    
                    <h3>11.4 Final Determination</h3>
                    <p>Eligibility decisions are made in the Company's sole discretion and are final. Approved refunds are processed to the original payment method, less the $500 processing fee.</p>
