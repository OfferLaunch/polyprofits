                <p>At PolyProfits, we strive to provide you with the best possible service, but we cannot guarantee that your use of our service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free. We do not warrant that the results obtained from using our service will be accurate or reliable. You acknowledge and agree that from time to time, we may remove the service for indefinite periods or cancel it at any time, without prior notice to you. Your use of our service is entirely at your own risk, and our service and all products and services delivered through our service are provided "as is" and "as available," without any representations, warranties, or conditions of any kind, whether express or implied, including all implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, fitness for a particular purpose, durability, title, and non-infringement, except as expressly stated by us.</p>
                <p>In no event shall PolyProfits, our directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, interns, suppliers, service providers, or licensors be liable for any injury, loss, claim, or any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages of any kind, including, without limitation, lost profits, lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data, replacement costs, or any similar damages, whether based in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, arising from your use of our service or any products procured using the service, or for any other claim related in any way to your use of the service or any product, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any content or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the service or any content (or product) posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the service, even if advised of their possibility. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

                <h2>SECTION 16 – INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
                <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless PolyProfits and our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, directors, agents, contractors, licensors, service providers, subcontractors, suppliers, interns, and employees from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third-party due to or arising out of your breach of these Terms of Service or the documents they incorporate by reference, or your violation of any law or the rights of a third-party.</p>

                <h2>SECTION 17 – SEVERABILITY</h2>
                <p>If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service. Such a determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.</p>

You will remain liable for all amounts due up to and including the date of termination, and we may deny you access to our Services (or any part thereof) accordingly. The parties' obligations and liabilities incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the termination of this agreement for all purposes.</p>

                <h2>SECTION 19 – ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2>
                <p>If we fail to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service, it does not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.
